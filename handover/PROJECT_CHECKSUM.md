# Project Checksum Manifest

Verified by `workflowctl check-handover --config self-governance.yaml`. Each row's digest is the
full SHA-256 of the referenced file's exact working-tree bytes at the time this manifest was
generated. A mismatch means the file changed after this manifest was written — regenerate the
manifest (recompute size + `sha256sum`) rather than treating a legitimate edit as tampering.
