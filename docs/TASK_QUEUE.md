# Task Queue

Authoritative record of every tracked workstream for `ai-workflow-engine`. This document is the
`governance.task_queue` source in `self-governance.yaml`; `docs/current_task.md` and
`docs/remaining_tasks.md` mirror it and must not contradict it — `workflowctl check-task-state`
and `workflowctl check-governance` verify that automatically.

## M-1 — Deterministic inspection and validation

Status: Done

Milestone 1 (v0.1.0, released 2026-07-16): read-only Git inspection, governance/task-state
mirror checks, source-aware handover checksum verification, protected-path enforcement,
structured CLI/JSON results.

## M-2 — Governed prompt generation

Status: Done

Deterministic, canonically-hashed prompt rendering, structural validation, and atomic
no-clobber storage for all seven workflow stages. Approved after three independent fresh
implementation reviews (two real defects found and fixed; several test-coverage gaps closed).
Not yet committed — see `docs/current_task.md`.

## GOV-1 — Bootstrap self-governance documentation

Status: Done

Pointed this project's own governance tooling at its own repository: the five governance
documents, `self-governance.yaml`, and the pure-documentation files (`DECISION_LOG.md`,
`CHANGELOG.md`, `AGENT_PROTOCOL.md`) that had no existing counterpart. All acceptance criteria
demonstrated in `docs/VALIDATION_REPORT.md`; closed 2026-07-17 per the approved
`docs/MASTER_ROADMAP.md` (task T-101). Decision record: `docs/GOVERNANCE_AUDIT.md`.

## T-101 — Close out GOV-1

Status: Done

Formal GOV-1 closeout per the approved master roadmap: status flip, mirror synchronization,
changelog/decision-log entries, handover refresh. Completed 2026-07-17.

## T-102 — Documentation synchronization

Status: Done

Fixed the prose drift recorded in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`: marked
`docs/milestone-2-plan.md` implemented/approved, extended `README.md` and
`docs/architecture.md` to cover the prompt subsystem, refreshed stale counts (the
point-in-time figures in `docs/GOVERNANCE_AUDIT.md` were deliberately left as accurate
historical records). Completed 2026-07-17.

## T-103 — Lightweight CI

Status: Done

Human-approved Stage 0 addition (2026-07-17): `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the test suite,
lint, format check, strict typing, and the three repository-content governance checks against a
CI-generated config copy (`check-git` is excluded in CI because a detached-HEAD checkout has no
upstream — an environment artifact, not a defect). Every step verified locally. Completed
2026-07-17.

## M-3 — Non-interactive agent execution

Status: Planned

Codex read-only review and scoped OpenCode writes, strict report schemas, isolation, timeouts,
and independent claim verification, plus the workflow-state capabilities Milestone 2 deferred
here. Task breakdown T-301..T-306 in `docs/MASTER_ROADMAP.md`. Depends on Stage 0
(T-101..T-103) completing first.

## M-4 — Controlled commit and push

Status: Planned

Approval-bound staging allowlists, commit verification, protected-path enforcement,
remote/upstream checks, and explicit push gates. Depends on M-3.
